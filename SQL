SQL

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);  --same as above

The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
Operator 	Description
= 	Equal
<> 	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=
> 	Greater than
< 	Less than
>= 	Greater than or equal
<= 	Less than or equal
BETWEEN 	Between a certain range
LIKE 	Search for a pattern
IN 	To specify multiple possible values for a column



SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT City = 'Berlin';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City IN ('Berlin','MÃ¼nchen'));

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;   -- if there are multiple records for Argentina, then it will sort their CustomerName



We do not insert any number into the CustomerID field because CustomerID column is an auto-increment field and will be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into the table.

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');



SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;  -- there is also IS NOT NULL



UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;  -- If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!


DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';  -- If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!



SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 10; -- retrive first 10 records to avoid performance problems if there are 10000



SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;  -- returns the minimum value in the Price column

-- There is also MIN, MAX, AVG and SUM



There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

    % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
    _ - The underscore represents a single character


There is also NOT LIKE ...



SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;   -- The BETWEEN operator is inclusive.  There is also NOT BETWEEN



Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

    (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table
